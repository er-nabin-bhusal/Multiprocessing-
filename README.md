# Multiprocessing-
This repo is about performing multiprocessing in python.

## Multiprocessing
It is the optimum utilization of the capacity of your computer. If you have a concept for large computation and can be performed simultaneously then multiprocessing is the right 
thing to do. 
I have demonstrated a small example for it. 
In the example bascally the multiprocessing module is imported and processes are created with it passing the name of the function
along with the args. 
And each process is started in defined order. 
And lastly we join all the processes.
